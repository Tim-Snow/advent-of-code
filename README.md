## Set-up

Create a `.env` file containing the following environment variables:

```sh
DAY="" # The day to run, 1 - 25
YEAR="" # The year to run, 2015 - Current year
USER_AGENT="" # Your email address
COOKIE="" # Your session cookie header, inspect network logs in browser to find yours
```

## Running

To run rust solutions use: `cargo run`

To run typescript solutions use: `yarn ts`

To run go solutions use: `./run-go.sh` (this saves you needing to change to the src directory before running `go run .`)
